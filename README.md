For this project we analyze a dataset of medical records for the purpose of finding bacteria cultures most suitable for lab-grown meat. 
More specifically, we have 153 individuals, and we want to know the 10 most common bacteria cultures in their navel, and how often they wash their navel. 

We then chart these findings in three interactive graphs. 

## Graph 1: Bar Chart
