For this project we analyze a dataset of medical records for the purpose of finding bacteria cultures most suitable for lab-grown meat. 
More specifically, we have 153 individuals, and we want to know the 10 most common bacteria cultures in their navel, and how often they wash their navel. 

We then chart these findings in three interactive graphs. 

## Graph 1: Bar Chart

Theres actually a bit more going on in this one. This horizontal bar chart shows the ten most common bacteria cultures per person. Every time you select a different person, the chart will change.

## Graph 2: Gauge Chart

This chart, which is designed in the style known as a 'gauge chart', measures belly-button washing frequency i.e 'Scrubs Per Week'. 
Any correlation between washing frequency and most common bacteria cultures measured in the bar chart has not yet been determined.
